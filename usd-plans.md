# TeamAlloc – Pricing & Licensing Model (USD)

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the pricing philosophy, licensing structure, and concrete USD price points for TeamAlloc.

It is intended for:

* Founders and product leadership
* Sales and go-to-market teams
* Enterprise customers and procurement departments
* Internal commercial alignment

TeamAlloc is positioned and priced as a **strategic planning and decision-support system**, not as a seat-based productivity tool.

---

## 1. Pricing Philosophy

TeamAlloc is licensed as a **tenant-based subscription**.

Pricing is determined by the **number of resources under management** within a tenant.

A resource represents a unit of allocatable planning capacity (e.g. employee, role-based position, or external capacity pool).

### Core Principles

* No per-user pricing
* No AI consumption-based pricing
* No penalties for transparency or collaboration
* Predictable operational expenditure (OPEX)

Pricing reflects:

* Avoided overcommitment
* Avoided misallocation
* Reduced planning risk
* Improved management decision quality

---

## 2. Why Resources Are the Primary Pricing Metric

In TeamAlloc, a resource is:

* A capacity provider (FTE)
* A cost carrier
* A planning risk unit
* The anchor for allocation conflict detection

Resources correlate directly with:

* Planning complexity
* Financial exposure
* Organizational decision risk

User count and project count do not reliably reflect economic impact and are therefore not used as primary pricing axes.

## 3. Pricing Plans (USD)

Prices are shown as monthly equivalents. Annual contracts are standard.
