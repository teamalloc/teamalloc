# TeamAlloc – Discount, Negotiation, and Partner / Reseller Model

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines a **controlled discount framework** and a **partner / reseller margin model** for TeamAlloc.

It is designed to:

* protect long-term pricing integrity,
* enable predictable enterprise negotiations,
* support partners without commoditizing the product,
* ensure internal consistency across sales, founders, and future account executives.

The guiding principle is simple:

> **Discounts must be earned through commitment, not pressure.**

---

## 1. Pricing Integrity Principles

Before defining numbers, the following rules apply universally:

1. Discounts are **never justified by user count**.
2. Discounts are **never justified by "AI usage" arguments**.
3. Discounts are tied to:

   * duration of commitment,
   * scope of adoption,
   * reduction of sales or operational cost.
4. No discount must undermine the perception of TeamAlloc as a **strategic system**.

These principles prevent TeamAlloc from drifting into commodity SaaS pricing dynamics.

## 2. Standard Discount Framework

All discounts are expressed as **percentage reductions on list price**.

### 2.1 Contract Duration Discounts (Primary Lever)

| Commitment           | Discount | Rationale                      |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| 12 months (standard) | 0%       | Baseline                       |
| 24 months            | 8%       | Reduced churn and sales effort |
| 36 months            | 15%      | Strategic partnership signal   |

**Rules**

* Duration discounts apply tenant-wide
* No stacking with ad-hoc discounts

---

### 2.2 Volume Expansion Discounts (Controlled)

Applies **only** when customers exceed licensed resource tiers.

| Expansion Type         | Discount                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| +50 resources          | 5% on incremental portion |
| +100 resources         | 8% on incremental portion |
| Unlimited (Enterprise) | Negotiated flat rate      |

**Important**

* Discounts apply only to the *additional* scope
* Base license remains undiscounted

---

### 2.3 Organizational Rollout Discounts

Used for customers committing to **multi-unit or group-wide adoption**.

| Rollout Scope      | Discount                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 2–3 tenants        | 5%                      |
| 4–6 tenants        | 10%                     |
| Group-wide rollout | Individually negotiated |

**Condition**

* Rollout plan must be contractually defined
* Phased activation is allowed

---

### 2.4 Early-Stage / Lighthouse Customer Discount

Reserved for **strategically valuable reference customers**.

| Condition                | Discount  |
| ------------------------ | --------- |
| Public reference         | up to 10% |
| Case study participation | up to 15% |

**Approval**

* Founder or CEO approval required
* Time-limited (max 24 months)

---

## 3. Explicitly Forbidden Discounts

The following discount rationales are **not permitted**:

* "We only have five users"
* "Executives are just viewers"
* "We are still evaluating AI internally"
* "Other tools charge per seat"
* "We might grow later"

Allowing these would directly undermine the pricing logic.

---

## 4. Negotiation Playbook (Enterprise Sales)

### 4.1 Default Negotiation Sequence

1. **Re-anchor on risk avoided** (capacity conflicts, misallocation)
2. **Re-anchor on predictability** (no per-user or AI fees)
3. Offer **contract duration** as first concession
4. Offer **rollout discount** as second concession
5. Never lead with price cuts

---

### 4.2 Procurement Objection Mapping

| Objection                  | Approved Response                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Too expensive per user"   | "We do not price by users to avoid limiting transparency." |
| "We need a pilot discount" | "We offer a reduced-scope Essential plan instead."         |
| "AI should be extra"       | "AI is embedded in planning quality, not sold separately." |

---

## 5. Partner & Reseller Strategy

TeamAlloc partners are **capacity multipliers**, not volume discounters.

Partners are expected to:

* sell planning transformation, not licenses only,
* provide domain expertise (PMO, HR, consulting),
* reduce customer onboarding and support load.

---

## 6. Partner Types

### 6.1 Referral Partner

**Role**

* Lead generation only

**Compensation**

* **10% of first-year net contract value**
* One-time referral fee

No pricing authority.

---

### 6.2 Authorized Reseller

**Role**

* License resale
* First-level commercial contact

**Margin Model**

* **20% margin on list price**

**Conditions**

* No discretionary discounting
* Uses official pricing and messaging

---

### 6.3 Strategic Implementation Partner

**Role**

* Sales + onboarding + domain consulting
* Long-term customer relationship

**Margin Model**

| Annual Net Volume | Margin |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| €0 – €50k         | 25%    |
| €50k – €150k      | 30%    |
| €150k+            | 35%    |

**Additional Benefits**

* Priority roadmap input
* Joint case studies
* Co-marketing

---

## 7. Discount Authority Matrix

| Role          | Max Discount |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| Sales         | 5%           |
| Head of Sales | 10%          |
| Founder / CEO | 20%          |

Discounts above 15% require:

* documented rationale
* explicit business value (reference, rollout, duration)

---

## 8. Anti-Commoditization Guardrails

To preserve long-term value:

* No public promo pricing
* No seasonal discounts
* No "AI surcharge" removals
* No seat-based fallback pricing

Every exception increases long-term erosion risk.

---

## 9. Summary

* Discounts are structured, earned, and bounded
* Negotiation focuses on commitment, not concessions
* Partners are incentivized for value creation, not price erosion
* Pricing integrity is treated as a strategic asset

> **TeamAlloc competes on decision quality, not discount depth.**
