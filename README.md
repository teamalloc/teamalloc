# TeamAlloc
### Strategic Workforce and Project Allocation Planning

## Overview

**TeamAlloc** is a strategic planning system designed to help medium-sized organizations make **reliable, forward-looking decisions** about people, projects, and capacity.

It provides management with a clear, structured view of **what can realistically be delivered**, under which assumptions, and with which trade-offs—before commitments are made.

TeamAlloc focuses on **planning and decision support**, not on execution or time tracking.

## What Problem TeamAlloc Solves

Many organizations face the same challenges:

- Projects are approved without a realistic view of available capacity
- Resource conflicts are discovered too late
- Decisions rely on spreadsheets, assumptions, or fragmented tools
- HR planning and project planning are not sufficiently aligned

TeamAlloc addresses these challenges by creating a **single planning model** that connects:
- workforce capacity,
- project demand,
- organizational structures,
- and alternative planning scenarios.

---

## Core Concept

At its core, TeamAlloc answers one fundamental management question:

> *“Given our people, roles, and constraints, what is actually feasible?”*

To do so, TeamAlloc models:
- **Resources** as capacity providers (FTE, roles, costs)
- **Projects** as demand drivers (effort, timelines, dependencies, revenue)
- **Scenarios** as alternative planning realities
- **Plans** as curated decision sets for management

## Key Capabilities

### Strategic Workforce Planning
- Plan workforce capacity in FTE and person-days
- Model roles, teams, and cost structures
- Identify bottlenecks and overallocations early

### Project and Portfolio Planning
- Plan projects with effort, timelines, and dependencies
- Understand the impact of new initiatives on existing commitments
- Compare competing priorities in a consistent model

### Scenario-Based Decision Making
- Create multiple planning scenarios (“what-if” analyses)
- Compare alternatives without modifying the baseline plan
- Document assumptions and consequences transparently

### Financial Perspective
- Associate costs with resources
- Associate revenue with projects
- Build a planning-level profit and loss view across scenarios

## Integration with Existing Systems

TeamAlloc is designed to **integrate seamlessly into existing IT landscapes**.

- Open, well-defined interfaces allow integration with **market-standard systems** such as HR platforms, ERP systems, project management tools, and financial systems.
- The same integration mechanisms support **custom or in-house systems**, enabling organizations to reuse existing master data and processes.
- External systems can reference TeamAlloc entities using their own identifiers, ensuring clean system boundaries and long-term integration stability.

This makes TeamAlloc suitable both as a standalone planning tool and as part of a broader enterprise architecture.

## AI-Supported Planning

TeamAlloc incorporates **artificial intelligence as a planning assistant**, not as an autonomous decision-maker.

AI capabilities are used to:
- highlight potential capacity conflicts and planning risks,
- suggest alternative allocations or scenarios,
- support “what-if” analyses and sensitivity assessments,
- assist users in exploring feasible planning options more efficiently.

All decisions remain fully transparent and under human control.  
AI serves as an **augmentation of management judgment**, not a replacement.

---

## What TeamAlloc Is Not

TeamAlloc is intentionally **not**:
- a time tracking system
- a task or ticket management tool
- an operational project execution platform

Instead, it complements existing systems by focusing on **upstream planning and decision quality**.

---

## Value for Management

For management teams, TeamAlloc provides:

- **Clarity** instead of assumptions
- **Transparency** instead of hidden overload
- **Decision confidence** through structured scenarios
- **Alignment** between HR planning and project strategy

This enables better prioritization, more realistic commitments, and fewer late-stage surprises.

---

## Typical Use Cases

- Annual and mid-year capacity planning
- Portfolio prioritization and re-planning
- Evaluating the impact of new strategic initiatives
- Aligning hiring plans with project roadmaps
- Preparing management and board decisions

---

## Positioning

**TeamAlloc** is positioned as:

> *A strategic planning system for workforce and project allocation.*

It bridges the gap between **people planning**, **project planning**, and **enterprise systems**, enabling organizations to move from reactive adjustments to **deliberate, scenario-based, and AI-supported decisions**.
