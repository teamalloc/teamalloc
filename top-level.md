# TeamAlloc

### Enterprise Strategic Planning & Decision Intelligence

## Overview

**TeamAlloc** is an enterprise-grade strategic planning platform designed to help organizations move from reactive
adjustments to **reliable, forward-looking decisions** about their most valuable assets: people, projects, and capital.

It provides senior management with the **Decision Intelligence** needed to understand what can realistically be
delivered, under which assumptions, and with which trade-offs—enabling a move from "gut feeling" to data-driven
commitments.

TeamAlloc occupies the critical space between **high-level strategy** and **operational execution**, focusing
exclusively on planning quality and decision support.

## The Enterprise Challenge: Closing the Strategy-to-Execution Gap

Many organizations suffer from "Planning Blind Spots":

- **Capacity Blindness**: Projects are approved without a verified view of actual available capacity.
- **Delayed Conflict Discovery**: Resource bottlenecks are identified during execution, leading to costly delays.
- **Data Silos**: Planning relies on fragmented spreadsheets, inconsistent assumptions, and disconnected tools.
- **Misalignment**: HR hiring plans and strategic project roadmaps are not synchronized.

TeamAlloc addresses these challenges by creating a **Unified Planning Model** that connects workforce capacity, project
demand, and financial constraints into a single source of truth.

## Core Value Proposition

At its core, TeamAlloc answers the fundamental management question:

> *“Given our resources and constraints, what is our optimal path to delivery?”*

By modeling **Resources** (capacity, roles, costs), **Projects** (effort, revenue, dependencies), and **Scenarios** (
alternative realities), TeamAlloc provides a sandbox for strategic optimization.

## Key Capabilities

### Strategic Resource Optimization

- **Capacity Planning**: Model workforce capacity in FTE and person-days across global teams.
- **Role-Based Modeling**: Align talent supply with project demand using standardized roles and custom skill attributes.
- **Early Warning System**: Identify bottlenecks and overallocations months before they impact the bottom line.

### Portfolio & Project Intelligence

- **Scenario Comparison**: Create multiple "what-if" scenarios to evaluate the impact of new initiatives without
  disrupting the baseline.
- **Dependency Management**: Map finish-to-start constraints to ensure realistic project sequencing.
- **Investment Transparency**: Associate revenue with projects and costs with resources to build a planning-level P&L.

### AI-Augmented Decision Support

- **Risk Identification**: AI assistants highlight planning risks and potential capacity conflicts.
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Intelligent suggestions for alternative allocations and scenario improvements.
- **Augmented Judgment**: AI serves as a powerful assistant, keeping humans in full control while enhancing their
  decision quality.

## Enterprise-Grade Foundations

TeamAlloc is built for the requirements of modern enterprise IT and compliance:

- **Strict Tenant Isolation**: Secure, isolated environments for different business units or subsidiaries.
- **Granular Security (RBAC & ACL)**: A sophisticated authorization model combining global roles with instance-level
  access control.
- **Financial Data Protection**: Specialized permissions (FINANCE RBAC) ensure sensitive cost and revenue data is
  restricted to "need-to-know" personnel.
- **Full Auditability**: Automatic CRUD logging for every planning change, ensuring compliance and transparency.
- **OIDC/Keycloak Integration**: Seamless integration with enterprise identity providers for secure, centralized user
  management.

---

## Seamless Integration

TeamAlloc is designed to be a first-class citizen in your IT landscape:

- **Open Architecture**: Well-defined APIs allow for deep integration with HR (Workday, SAP), ERP, and Project
  Management tools.
- **External Identifier Mapping**: Reference TeamAlloc entities using IDs from your existing master data systems.
- **Custom Metadata**: Use the flexible **Attributes** system to store external data like "Cost Center" or "Technical
  Skill Level" directly on planning entities.

## What TeamAlloc Is Not

To maintain focus and high value, TeamAlloc is intentionally **not**:

- A time-tracking or timesheet tool.
- An operational task management platform (like Jira or Trello).
- A project execution system.

By focusing on the **upstream planning phase**, TeamAlloc complements these tools and ensures they are fed with
realistic, approved plans.

---

## Strategic Value for Management

For the C-Suite and Senior Management, TeamAlloc delivers:

- **Clarity & Confidence**: Move from assumptions to structured, verified planning data.
- **Agility**: Rapidly evaluate the impact of market changes or new opportunities.
- **Financial Alignment**: Bridge the gap between project strategy and financial reality.
- **Operational Stability**: Reduce late-stage project failures by ensuring capacity is realistically allocated.

**TeamAlloc** turns resource planning from a back-office administrative task into a **competitive strategic advantage**.
